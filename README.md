This HTML document features a simple animation of a Pac-Man character.
The Pac-Man moves horizontally across the screen.
It includes two buttons:
"start" to initiate movement
"stop" to halt it (though the stop function isn't implemented).
The animation alternates between two sprites as it moves.
The movement is controlled by a move function, updating position and sprite every 200 milliseconds.
This creates a playful visual effect.
