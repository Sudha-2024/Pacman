Step 1:This HTML document features a simple animation of a Pac-Man character.
step 2:The Pac-Man moves horizontally across the screen.
step 3:It includes two buttons:
"start" to initiate movement
"stop" to halt it (though the stop function isn't implemented).
Step 4:The animation alternates between two sprites as it moves.
Step 5:The movement is controlled by a move function, updating position and sprite every 200 milliseconds.
Step 6:This creates a playful visual effect.
